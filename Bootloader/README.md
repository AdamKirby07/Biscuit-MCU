# Biscuit Microcontroller Bootloader

This repository contains the bootloader for the Biscuit MCU. 

## Overview

The bootloader is a **custom implementation of the USB-uC**. For detailed documentation and configuration settings, please refer to the original source here:

[Link to USB-uC Documentation](https://github.com/johnnydrazzi/USB-uC)  

## Important Notes

- **This bootloader is not an original work**: The implementation is based on USB-uC, and I do not hold copyright over the bootloader code. It is included here as a separate section to differentiate from the main Biscuit MCU repository.
- The USB-uC bootloader comes with **comprehensive documentation** and allows you to configure it with your required settings. I recommend using that documentation for a better understanding and proper configuration.

## Why Is This Separate?

To respect the copyright of the original authors and maintain clarity, this bootloader section has been added as a separate repository or submodule. It is provided solely for integration with the Biscuit MCU project. 

Please configure it to suit your specific needs.
