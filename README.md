## Features  

- **Beginner-Friendly Design**: Alligator-clip terminals make connections easy.  
- **Battery Connector Included**: Power the BiscuitMCU easily with the included battery connector. The board supports 7 to 12 volts DC (non-lithium) batteries, such as AA, AAA, or 9-volt batteries. This ensures safety for beginners, as lithium-based products are not used. *Note: This board does not charge the batteries.*  
- **Drag-and-Drop Programming**: The built-in bootloader allows the BiscuitMCU to appear as a USB storage drive (U2F drive). Simply drag and drop your compiled code to program it.  
- **Arduino IDE Support**: BiscuitMCU works seamlessly with the Arduino IDE, making programming straightforward and intuitive. (Library details will be provided soon.)  
- **Advanced Programming**: For more experienced users, the BiscuitMCU supports uploading compiled hex files directly from the MPLAB IDE—a great way to learn commercial microcontroller programming.  
- **USB-IF Compliant**: The BiscuitMCU complies with USB-IF standards, drawing a maximum of 450mA of current, which is plenty for a wide range of projects.  
- **Built-In Safety Features**: Includes an auto-resettable fuse that protects against overcurrent, resetting within 24 hours for uninterrupted use.  
- **Expansion and Future Upgrades**: The upcoming *Add on board* will add even more beginner-friendly functionality to the BiscuitMCU with a simple bolt on design. This feature is currently in testing and will be released soon.
